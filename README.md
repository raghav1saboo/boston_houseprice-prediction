## Introduction
The Boston House Price Prediction project is designed to predict house prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, code, and a trained model for predicting house prices based on various features.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- Build a machine learning model to predict house prices accurately.
- Utilize feature engineering and data preprocessing to enhance model performance.
- Provide insights into the factors that influence house prices in Boston.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and feature engineering.
- Machine learning model training using regression techniques.
- Evaluation and comparison of different models for predictive accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
